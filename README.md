# WeatherDashboard

I created a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather api that allows users to enter any city they choose to get the current and 5 day forecast for that city.
I also created a recent searches list that grabs the city from the local storage and shows up on the page in a list. The user can also delete all search history as well.

You can access the deployed page at https://kevno5.github.io/WeatherDashboard/
